# Contributing to OpenCatapult
Hi Friends, thanks for checking out this page. We welcome everyone to contribute to OpenCatapult.

These are mostly guidelines, not rule. Use your best judgement, and feel free to propose changes to improve this document.

## Questions and Feedback
If you have any questions or feedback, please don't submit Issue directly in this repository. Instead, let's discuss them first in the [community forum](https://community.opencatapult.net/). When you have gotten confirmation that your feedback is not currently sitting in the backlog line, feel free to submit an Issue in this repository.

Please make sure you have read our [Code of conduct](https://docs.opencatapult.net/guides/dev-guides/contribute) before interacting with others in the forum. We want to maintain healthy environment for community.

## Submitting Issue
When submitting an issue, you will be presented with two templates: `Bug report` and `Feature request`. Please choose one that is sufficient for your need. Fill the details as clear as possible so other contributors can understand the context of your submitted issue. Please don't submit pull requests without submitting an issue first. This is important to make sure no duplicate works are being done for the same problem.

## Submitting Pull Request
When submitting pull request, you are required to fill some details about the changes. Please provide appropriate information based on the template. If you know a person who is appropriate to review your PR, please assign him/her directly, otherwise just assign noone. If you don't get a review for three days, please reach out one of OpenCatapult maintainers so they can help you assigning someone as reviewer.

Please make sure you have read our [Coding standard](https://docs.opencatapult.net/guides/dev-guides/coding-style) before submitting pull request to minimize "request changes" because of incorrect usage of code styling.
